# soccer-goal-game
  This is a simple soccer game:


  Objective - Score as many goals as you can without missing

  Instructions: 

  -Press the up arrow key/any key to kick

  -If the ball touches the goal it's a score

  -There is a score counter on the left

  -If you miss your score is set to 0 and you lose. 
  
  -Time the goal as it moves back in forth, watch and wait to kick the ball.

  -Sometimes the goal runs slowly when you first open the game, wait until it runs quickly then refresh the page to ensure the goal path is correct

  My orignial idea was to create a futuristic soccer game with a bright green ball, and colorful/futuristic ai.
I couldn't find any assets good enough to create the game like that, so I decided to go with a regular soccer theme, in my opinion
it looks better anyways. I worked very hard on this game. It took me around 13 total hours to figure out the collision detection,
I was looking in the wrong places and was having trouble understanding some documentation. It's pretty basic collision detection which tracks
the x and y value of each image using a function called getElementRect(). But what I couldn't figure out is that the x and y value dont work like normal x and y value on a graph like in algebra class. It works like (0, 0) is in the top left. After finally figuring it out I then had to figure out how
to debug, and update the score because it would not work for the life of me. I finally figured it all out. It took hours of repitition and running console.log("test") inside of my functions. I have never been more proud of myself for a project. Or anything in my life for that matter. I figured out this
extremely difficult task. It makes me feel like I can learn anything that has to do with code. I still have a few more things I would like to do with this game. Perhaps create a play game screen with a few difficulty options. And I definitely want to create a leaderboard. So that all of my friends and family who play the game will be displayed on the leaderboard. Anyway I had a great time making the game,(sometimes) and I hope this suffices as a read me.
