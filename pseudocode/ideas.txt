MVP:

-make ui, surroundings to take up white space etc. 

-create ability to change from still ball img to rolling ball
after pressing spacebar

-make the image go straight up the screen

-after it hits top of screen/goal, ball needs to reset
on the bottom

-create zoom element to make rolling ball image appear smaller 
as it goes up the screen

-create goal that moves back and forth

-create ability for ball to hit the goal and win!/miss and lose
(if more time- ball will reduce score counter/miss does nothing)

-create timer at the top, and score counter

-create sidelines/background

--make auto scroll function to follow ball on taller browser body

MAYBES:

-a few different movement patterns/speed to switch after a 
player hits the shot for the goal

-create ability to have a power bar that is at max at 0.6sec
and is at lowest after 1 sec, which activates after the player
times the goal and power bar by pressing spacebar
-ability for ball to change speed depending on what time 
spacebar was pressed according to the power bar

-perhaps endless mode with score counter

-perhaps main menu
