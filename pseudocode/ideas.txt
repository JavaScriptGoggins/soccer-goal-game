MVP:

-create ability to change from still ball img to rolling ball
after pressing spacebar

-make the image go straight up the screen

-create zoom element to make rolling ball image appear smaller 
as it goes up the screen

-create goal that moves back and forth

-create ability for ball to hit the goal and win

-create timer at the top, and score counter

MAYBES:

-a few different movement patterns/speed to switch after a 
player hits the shot for the goal

-create ability to have a power bar that is at max at 0.6sec
and is at lowest after 1 sec, which activates after the player
times the goal and power bar by pressing spacebar
-ability for ball to change speed depending on what time 
spacebar was pressed according to the power bar
